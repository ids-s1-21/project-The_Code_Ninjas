## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r GDP- Dollar price}
bigmac %>%
  filter(name == "South Africa")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y =))+
  geom_point()
```
Possible countries:
-Turkey
-Hong kong
-switzerland
-Brazil


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
