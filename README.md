The Big-mac Index and the Purchasing Power Parity
================
The Code Ninjas

## Summary

The aim of the project is to find out “What is Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and how has it changed over the years across countries?”. Purchasing Power Parity also known as PPP is basically an exchange rate of one currency for another which compares how much a typical basket of goods in one country costs compare to that of the other country. So, in theory, PPP should be equal to the exchange rate of these two countries, but in practice, this is usually not the case.

The Big-Mac Index dataset consists of 1,520 observations (rows) and 19 variables (columns). Each row represents a country at a specific time (year-month-date) while the columns represent crucial information related to the countries. The data is only accountable for the years 2000-2021.

The Big Mac prices are from McDonald’s, and the exchange rates are from Thomson Reuters. The GDP per person data is from the IMF World Economic Outlook reports.

The Big Mac Index is used as it would be an accurate way of looking at the PPP in the real world since the burger would be the same and hold the same intrinsic value no matter what country it is in.

One of the common assumptions surrounding PPP is that a lower income country will on average, have lower prices compared to a high income country. This could be due to lower labour costs and an overall inability to afford more costly goods in a low income economy. This will mean that a person in a low income economy will be able to buy less in a high income economy than they could before.This would therefore give us the impression that PPP is lower in low-income economies than in high income economies.

The assumption that PPP is higher in high income countries is supported by this graph - PPP by GDP per capita. Raw Index shows how overvalued/undervalued a countries currency is compared to the big mac price in each country. Effectively a country with a highly overvalued currency will have a high PPP and a country with a highly undervalued currency will have a low PPP. Until 2007, there were high rates of GDP growth (with greater investor confidence). However, post 2008, industry declined, and this had led to higher levels of inflation and a reduction in imports, all of this led to the Lira fall in value up till 2021. This would support the assumption that PPP is lower in low income economies as effective PPP fell along with GDP.

The swiss franc has increased in value continually for a substantial time and it is seen as a safe haven for foreign exchange traders, who will usually exchange their money for francs during times of financial crisis. This has meant that the swiss have had high levels of PPP for a long period of time due to the investor confidence in the franc. </font>

Hong Kong is a high GDP country so it would be expected that the Hong Kong dollar would be overvalued due to Hong Kong's high level of GDP per capita and investor confidence. This means we would expect Hong Kong to have a high level of PPP. However this is not the case as the HK$ is "pegged" against the American dollar. This means that the HK$ will change in value as the US$ changes in value. As the US$ is stable it will stay around the same level resulting in sustained low PPP for Hong Kong.

Brazil is a relatively low GDP country and Brazil’s PPP has varied from 2000 -2021 but in the period of 2006 to 2014 brazil had high levels of PPP. This was due to Brazil being one of the fastest growing economies in the world which huge levels of investor confidence. However, this fell after 2014 when Brazil experienced one of its worst recorded recessions in the countries history due to falling comodity prices and an internal political struggle which shook investor confidence. We could hypothesise from our knowledge of PPP and our initial plot that there is a positive correlation between PPP and GDP.

We had expected low income countries to have a lower PPP and this was certainly the case for Turkey and Brazil, which both saw reduced PPP in periods of economic struggle and reduced GDP.

We had also expected high income countries to have higher PPP and Switzerland supported this, which as a high GDP country has had consistently high PPP. However Hong Kong showed us that the opposite was the case, and we discovered they had a low PPP despite their high GDP. 
 Overall this has meant that there is some evidence of a correlation between GDP and PPP, as we expected. However in our research we discovered a counterexample, where factors such as economic policy provide an explanation. We need to consider that economic policies vary across countries, impacting prices of Big Macs across countries affecting PPP as calculated from this data, as well as the exchange rate. 

Therefore, we can conclude that GDP is not always an explanation for why PPP may be higher or lower, but it certainly has a contribution.
